W3C(World Wide Web Consortium)

A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

structure of html

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>...............</title>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
.....................

</html>



Tag: A html tag is a command placed in between the brackets.
